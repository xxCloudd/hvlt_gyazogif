# xxcloudd's cracked gyazo
i want to make myself clear that all i did was separate the gyazoGIF from
the rest of the gyazo, removed the unnecessary files, debugged and changed the
recording time limit to infinite, and i also changed the gyazo icon color
you can debug for yourself that it has nothing malicious in it, or VT etc.


###### How to use — Execute GyazoGIF.exe

###### Issues — Recording for too much time may timeout when uploading


###### Tip for practical use — Pin GyazoGIF.exe to the taskbar

##### Enjoy!
