cracked gyazo: unlimited recording time
(recording for too much time may timeout)
execute GyazoGIF.exe

i want to make myself clear that all i did was separate the gyazoGIF from
the rest of the gyazo, removed the unnecessary files, debugged and changed the
recording time limit to infinite, and i also changed the gyazo icon color

you can debug for yourself that it has nothing malicious in it, or VT etc.

tip / practical use: pin GyazoGIF.exe to the taskbar
